Hi Eugene

Thanks - yes, I got the changes to work OK. Centrality doesn't work but at least it doesn't crash the system - I can come back to that. I made a couple of other things work too. I've attached the changed scripts here.

Final key things to do:
- nuisance: global signal (GS) correction for seed based, centrality, reho
- nuisance: no global signal (NGS) correction for ALFF
- intensity coding for susan
- inversion for field map phase.

Also as discussed - I found a couple of other places where TR is hard coded and I flagged them up.
- check TR for compcor - not hard coded (consider checking against info in nifti header?)
- check TR for nuisance - not hard coded
It's a minor thing but it could potentially hold us up.

Thanks
Henry
